- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)

## Install and Run Locally

To install locally instead of running the app on a remote server, clone the repository to your computer then run `npm i` to install all dependencies.

Start the server with `npm start` then visit localhost:\[your port number here] in your web browser.

The default port number is 3001 but can be changed either inside server.js or with a `PORT` environment variable. The active port will be printed in the console when starting the server.
